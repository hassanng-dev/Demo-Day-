I am very passionate about health and being able to be the best you can in life! With this project I've created a full stack fitness application where users can look up free various workouts and food diets. Users have the ability to create their own accounts where they can keep track of their daily meals and keep track of their macronutrients.

How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, EJS, CSS5, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, and MongoDB

I coded this project using EJS and CSS for markup text and styling. With Javascript as my main language I give users the ability to keep track of their daily meals they have throughout the week. Users also have the ability to search estimated macronutrients of various foods. In the back-end I used MongoDB as my database. Express was used as my framework.

LESSON LEARNED:

The lesson I learned is the process of using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to save information to my database. I learned more about Javascript and how powerful it is in the client and server side. I am excited to create more projects!
