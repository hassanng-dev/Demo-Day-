I am very passionate about health and being able to be the best you can in life! With this project i've created a full stack fitness application where users can look up free various workouts and food diets. Users have the ability to create their own account where they can keep track of their weight and workouts to include into their daily lives.

How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, and MongoDB

How I built this project is using EJS and CSS for markup text and styling. I used Javascript for the logic of the project. With Javascript I was able to create a form where users can keep track of their meals they have throughout the day/week. Also used an API to grab macronutrients of foods that users are interesting in knowing such as, apples, chicken, and etc. Users also have the ability to "create a meal" where they can look up individauls items and combine it with other foods to have a total amount of macronutrients. An example of that would be if a User would like to make a pizza they would include cheese, dough, pepperoni, and tomato sauce and will return a total of all the macros. This feature gives the ability of putting away the calculator and have the math done for the user. In the back-end I used MongoDB to store any data I submitted to my database. Express was used to simplify the process of creating my database to store information. I was passionate about this project because I recongized that there were many times when I would go grocery shopping with just a mental list. After awhile I would forget an item or two and would have to make a second trip back.

LESSON LEARNED:

The lesson I learned is the process of using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to save information to my database. I learned more about Javascript and how powerful it is in the client and server side. I am excited to create more projects!
