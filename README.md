I am very passionate about health and being able to be the best you can in life! With this project i've created a full stack fitness application where users can look up free various workouts and foot diets. Users have the ability to create their own account where they can keep track of their weight and workouts to they include into their daily life.

How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, and MongoDB

How I built this project is using HTML and CSS for markup text and styling. I used Javascript for the logic of the project. With Javascript I was able to create a form where users can keep track of their weight goals. Depending on their goal they are given a list of various workouts and meal plans that they can follow to help achieve the weight they are aiming for. In the back-end I used MongoDB to store any data I submitted to my database. Express was used to simplify the process of creating my database to store information. I was passionate about this project because I recongized that there were many times when I would go grocery shopping with just a mental list. After awhile I would forget an item or two and would have to make a second trip back.

LESSON LEARNED:

The lesson I learned is the process of using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to save information to my database. I learned more about Javascript and how powerful it is in the client and server side. I am excited to create more projects!
